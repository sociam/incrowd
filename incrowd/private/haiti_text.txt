"Info: Santo 25 CAMP
March 30, 2010
by bagaydwol

Please share this info far and wide:

I am writing on behalf of a camp of 2800 people who have not yet been registered with any NGO.

Located at Santo 25, Rue Canaan #26, they have

NO shelter

NO latrines or other means of sanitation

NO access to potable water

NO food

There are about 20 amputees with no access to medical care

There are about 300 children from 2-12 years of age

There are about 20 infants

I have written Jack Harding (Camp Registration) about their situation.

Anything you can do to forward this information to the appropriate people will be greatly appreciated

"Community organization in Croix-des-Bouquets called FRADES (Fund for Social and Economic Development Resources) has taken in many children whose parents died in the quake. Some are showing signs of malnutrition. Orange-haired boy in video (see link) exhibits symptoms of kwashiorkor.

Needs: wheat, rice, peas, corn meal, spaghetti, vegetable oil; any food, even vitamins, would be appreciated.

Hygiene is an issue, so basic toiletries are needed as well. Cleaning products, toothbrushes and toothpaste, soap, laundry detergent, feminine hygiene essentials. Could use help building latrine.

Children need clothing as well, shoes especially.

Mattresses and bedsheets are desired because the children are currently sleeping on carpet floor in large tents, or on concrete.

Please help document the situation at FRADES if you go there. Take pictures if you can."

FULL TEXT:

Good-morning,

My name is Meme Selvandieu, PrÃ©sident/ Fondateur de la Fondation Rocher du Salut d'Haiti (FROCSAH).

I found your contact searching on the Internet http://helphaitiheal.wordpress.com/shelters-camps/ (Help Haiti Heal) and https://www.cimicweb.org/cmo/haiti/Pages/default.aspx (CMO Haiti) and with the help of two Italian friends abroad (Mauro Annarumma - Doctor in the Italian Army mauro.annarumma@gmail.com and Raphael Broniatowski - Volonteer in the Italian Red Cross raphael.bro@cripadova.it)


I'm writing you to request assistance for 200 families, including mine.

We are 30 people without shelter and assistance since January 12th. The other ones need food, medicines and clothes.


The friends I have contacted in Italy are trying to get in touch with the Italian Delegation of the Red Cross in Haiti through its headquarter in Rome but time is passing and we haven't received any help yet.

I understand you may be too busy to treat directly our kind of request but maybe you can tell us about new distributions of tents and  reliefs in PÃ©tion-Ville and where they are suppose to happen.

We all thank you very much for any kind of help you could give us.

We will be waiting for an answer."

I am a retired Firefighter doing some relief work in Haiti. I have a home in North Carolina but am living in the Dominican republic for the last few months.  After the quake I was asked by some doctor friends to lead a trip to do medical work there so on the 4th day after the quake we went in.  I am back in Haiti now preparing for the next visit of the same group. 
Story:
Last night a small camp of 1200 people were forced off the property they were camped on.  This was a camp that we had provided medical help to. This was done at night and with no warning.  1200 people moved out in darkness with no place to go many children many wounded were put out into the night. What is worse it was done by a supposed Catholic group at Villa Manrese.  The people were living behind the building on a flat spot of ground.  They were a very organized group and were in a safe place.  They had a small school there for the children.  They had food that they shared.  The directors name at Villa Manrese is Pere Andre Paul Grraud. I do not know what he knows about this but he was there in the house above the camp.  I have video of before and after this was done. I understand the need to remove the people from the property but the way they went about this must be reported.  This sort of thing has to be addressed and exposed to the world.  These people were treated like cattle and by fellow Haitians of a Catholic group. 

I am leaving Haiti Thursday for the DR but will be back in 2 weeks.  I will gladly share the video with you.

Food for the Poor has been very good to Esther's Mission''s Orphans in Fond Fred as managed by Mr. David Dorval who used to get the food from Port au prince. He was told because of the emergency situation in Port au Prince, it is difficult to get to him. PLEASE, forward this note to all concerned parties in this relief effort in HAITI. We need FOOD for our children in Fond Fred - Les Cayes. Mr. David Dorval, Director. Even if they get the food to Les Cayes, he will find a way to take the food to Fond Fred, they don't have to worry about going all the way there.

Please let me know what info you need right away to bring food to those children in the South of Haiti. It has been a month and they have no more food left to feed the children.

We have an orphanage, feeding program and medical clinic that serves a poor ravine community in this area.  Out of necessity, we have had to open two tent city areas to help the most vulnerable in our area (pregnant women, families with small children, and those with special needs).  We are hoping you may have 20 ShelterBoxes or similar waterproof tents available to help out these desperate people.  Is that possible?

Please let me know.  We would be happy to pick-up or whatever is necessary to make it easier for you. You may email me back or call me at 3734-9474.

"I have been forwarded an e-mail by a member of the Haitian Diaspora outlining the situation of 1500 children and their families in Croix-des-Bouquets (zone Li Lavoix) who are desperately in need of: food (specifically baby food and formula), water, medicine (anti-diarrhea, antibiotics, hygienic supplies, and anticoagulant), tents and, flashlights.

This e-mail appears to be circulating widely on the internet today (2/10/10) but I did not see it reported here after searching a .csv file of Ushahidi reports for the last 10 days. 

The e-mail also states that Haitians receiving medical treatment in the Dominican Republic have undergone unnecessary amputations and other medical procedures.  

The report originated with Mr. Carl Telemaque. His phone number is 3711 - 1771 but he may soon loose power or service.

***THIS IS MY BEST GUESS AT LOCATION AND IS NOT PART OF THE ORIGINAL MESSAGE***
After visually inspecting the most recent (1/21/10) imagery in Google Earth I would guess that the location of the group is the large IDP camp to the immediate SE of the cemetery. I have attached a screen shot of the location in OSM but didn't wan't to pinpoint it on the map since I'm not sure."

All efforts are being coordinated from Jackson Hospital through Dr. Greenâ€™s emergency execution team.

Our field hospital is set up at the airport and consists of 150 doctors and 170 to 250 patients. Â We are now consuming 1500 Liters of drinking water and 4000 Liters of tap water a day. Â For now we have exhausted our donation contacts and need help from your organization."

Church/School/Orphanage @Kenscoff with 175 children ages 1 to 17 Need Supplies! No assistance since the EQ. Call 509.390.54562 URGENT #haiti

I am attempting to refine location but not in 2-way comms at this time.                     Update: 2/4: This was confirmed by an expat I trust:
I talked to a Renelus Maxime who answered the phone. He is likely a â€œpastorâ€. His church (a poor one) supports them. The orphanage house 26 children. The house collapsed. They are now in an area called Villier. But he has now many more children from the school supported by the church. I was coming from dowtown to buy some food.
I told him to come to BICHaiti to ask for assistance if he qualifies for it.

"Three planned settlements have been finalized for sites in :
Parc St Claire in Delmas 33,
Parc Colofaire in Delmas 33,
and Tabarre 48 Carradeux Street.

The site at Tabarre is almost complete and the first families are expected to arrive in the coming says. It will accommodate over 3,000 people.  
The Civil Protection Department also began to set up 230 family tents at a site located in front of the airport.
According to IOM, partners are setting up 350 ten-person tents, as well as finalizing work on latrines, showers, and electricity for the settlement. The main constraint for efficient site planning remains insufficient sharing of information between partners.

The Civil Protection Department will launch a RADIO CAMPAIGN to request community leaders to provide data on displacement of populations in their communities.

This information will allow CCCM partners to identify focal points to manage camps and shelter sites.

IOM is preparing a Rapid Shelter Assessment (RSA) form to consolidate data across agencies on displacement in shelter sites."

"Bonjour,
Avec quelques amis, je suis en contact depuis des annÃ©es avec un ami en HaÃ¯ti, il est Ã  Port-au-Prince dans le quartier de Delmas 24. Apparemment ce quartier n'a reÃ§u l'aide d'aucune organisation humanitaire, que ce soit en nourriture, eau ou tentes.  Certains sortent bien du quartier pour aller chercher nourriture et eau ailleurs:  des queues de 1000 personnes et pour finir ce sont les plus violents qui emportent les denrÃ©es. 
116 personnes se trouvent dans un abri provisoire: Rue Caonabo, Delmas 24. Parmi elles, Ã©galement une femme enceinte et des enfants, parfois en bas Ã¢ge. 
Selon notre derniÃ¨re communication, leurs besoins les plus urgent sont  &quot;50 tentes familiales, de lâ€™eau et de la nourriture, des medicaments et des habits surtout pour les enfants ( une vingtaine)&quot;.

"If anyone is able to help out there is an orphange in Leogane that
is in desparate need of food, water and supplies for the children that
survived. The orphange name is Foyer Marie Reine des Apotres and the address is 5 Macombe Leogane, Route Nationale 2. 
The person over the orphange is Father Karl Michel Nozil. He is currently stuck in the States and has been trying to get back to the children but American Airlines keep cancelling the flights he has been booked on. He is now scheduled to on a flight that leaves on Feb 3rd. He so much wants to get back home. But if anyone is there please send supplies to
these children. NOTE from Ushahidi Mapper: this location cannot be confirmed but the submitter clicked just outside Leogane, rather than in the centre, which would be expected if it was not an exact location, so it may be more reliable than a random clicker."
"The orphansâ€™ needs (of food, water, medicine) were met by an aid team on 20 Jan., but they will need additional assistance.  100 children were barely alive, and 55 babies had died.  No aid teams will travel there without security, which is scarce.  Many of the surviving children will likely need to be transported to field hospitals or other locations where they can be helped further.

I don't see any reason those specific tents need to be transported across the disaster area when there are thousands in DR, but the expat network is too busy trying to find the damned containers to help me find the people.

If I am right, this camp has no pressing needs other than shelter and is a cohesive community.  It would make a great labor pool for some kind of enterprise, maybe a supply depot?

My location info is just to put it in the right region, I have no idea exactly where they are at this time.  We're trying to round up ex-employees in the disaspora to help but the liquour industry is closed on Saturdays.  Will update if I find something."

"Hello,

My name is Melanie I live in the U.S, a friend of mines father is a doctor in Haiti and is working out a hospital that needs supplies. It is across from Hotel Oloffston. The doctors name is Dr. Theodore Crevecoeur, he is operating from Hoptial St. Esprit located 124 Rue Capois or he may be at a clinic that is in the same plaza called Le Nouveau Centre Medico Hospitalier de la Rue Capois located 126 Rue Capois. Both of these locations are across the street from Hotel Oloffson. Dr. Crevecoeur has been back and forth to both, his cell phone numbers are 509-3455-7697 or 509-3872-2986 he most likely will not answer since he is working, but it is worth a try. We have been able to contact Dr. Crevecoeur through her uncle Agronome Rossini Crevecoeur his numbers are 509-3465-2310( main number for contact) or 509-3768-2138. From my understanding the cell phones that are functioning in Haiti are the numbers starting with 34, they are from cellular phone company Voila."

Jean, who is divorced from her husband, worked in Montreal.

â€œShe was taking a vacation after so long,â€ says William.

"I was wrong about the status of my team; I received a cell phone picture of them boarding a charter and assumed it was Santiago but it was in CONUS; they will not be in place until sometime Tuesday.  Will update again when I know more.

6-7 firefigher-paramedics on the charter with all supplies except schedule-1 drugs (morpheine), &quot;two SUVs full&quot;.  2 more flying commercially, all joining container(s) of supplies from CARE at Ft Lauderdale for the hop into DR Tuesday AM, deploying Jacmel Tuesday PM if all goes well.

Organization of team with similar composition to relieve our initial team is progressing well, though nothing is certain at this point.

Our team will not have a translator initially but I have some who are attempting to arrange independent travel.  One is in Great Britain and his wife is already in Haiti, he knows all the formal languages of the Americas plus Hebrew and ASL but lacks Creole.  He is attempting to find a donor for airfare, help if you can.

Our team will need resupply with water and, if possible food.  They left much of that in the trucks, loading to weight limit with medical supplies instead.  With Jacmel now supplied by sea I don't expect that to be a huge issue though.

Sorry about the incorrect initial report, I was not kept in the loop as they scrambled for a flight and I lept to the wrong conclusion based on outdated and incomplete information.  

Any intelligence or liaison information you can get to me would be helpful; I need to prepare a full briefing for them on mission options first thing in the morning."

"Hundred and thousands of people on Delmas 54 are in need of drastic help. They have signs all over saying &quot;no food or water.need food and water&quot; , the help that came to them two days ago has left and the people are hungry, tired, traumatized and wanting water. 

Today, the founder of people in need partnership,www.pinpartnership.org walked the streets, and looked for some of our missing partners. He said people are frantically looking for help. Not just food, they need medical assistance and there are still reports of people trapped inside there homes. 

The hostel that is a frequent stop for most of the doctors with no borders, missionaries and non-profit organizations , as well as a house for boys that are abandoned was collapsed, and everyone speculated that the founder was dead. He was sitting in front of the now collapsed building guarding it. Father Michael is alive. I was able to see this magical place, that will always be in my memories.

Our staff is all accounted for and we are now beginning efforts to find the partners. What has happened to Haiti, is a tragic event that is turning into a nightmare. Before three weeks ago, I was in Haiti. There was so many starving hungry people, and some would ask for water. Now, all are asking for everything.

We will start bringing in supplies in two weeks and hopefully with the help of other volunteers try to help the people of Haiti survive. I heard from a source, that there is no one leading the people of Haiti. 

If you want to read my news, you can visit our website at : www.pinpartnership.org- on the left side, click newspaper- then click my name, Jennifer Johnson.

May God watch over the survivors of this catastrophic earth quake and help those still alive in the buildings."

In the orphanage, there are about 80 babies between ages of 0 and 2 years. If you can provide any of these basic necessities, you will probably save some of these children since the orphanage is out of food and water. There will be people at the orphanage to receive any supplies. If you prefer to call to arrange a pickup, that will be OK.

"The IDF Medical and Rescue Team set up a field hospital in Port-Au-Prince and is beginning to treat patients there. The field hospital is prepared to receive dozens of ambulances evacuating injured children from the different disaster struck areas. Between Friday night and Saturday, dozens of truckloads of medical and logistical equipment were unloaded and the field hospital set up.

The field hospital includes 40 doctors, 25 nurses, paramedics, a pharmacy, a children's ward, a radiology department, an intensive care unit, an emergency room, two operating rooms, a surgical department, an internal department and a maternity ward. The hospital can treat approximately 500 patients each day, and in addition will perform preliminary surgeries.

&gt; I received word this morning that both the Aristide Foundation for
&gt; Democracy and the Medical University at Tabarre survived the
&gt; earthquake. They are receiving refugees and injured people -- 10,000
&gt; people are there right now.   They are providing medical care as
&gt; possible, as well as shelter and food.  There are 53 doctors on site
&gt; now (Cuban doctors who were carrying on mobile clinics in Haiti prior
&gt; to the earthquake and young Haitian doctors who recently finished
&gt; their training in Cuba).  But no medical supplies left.  Both
&gt; locations have large buildings and huge courtyard.  They are literally
&gt; five minutes from the airport -- over a road that is passable (Blvd 15
&gt; Octobre) in Tabarre.   There is also ample room to store supplies, and
&gt; a disciplined staff to manage them.  Both sites have generators, but
&gt; are running low on gas.  And are running out of water and food.
&gt;
&gt; My former colleagues at the Foundation got through a desperate plea to
&gt; ask us to help from this end to see if we can get them supplies.  I

&gt; through various contacts.  If anyone can assist with this -- or
&gt; suggest anyone other way to get medical supplies to them I would
&gt; greatly appreciate it. They not in the official NGO circuit.
&gt;
&gt; There are two contact people for the Foundation and the Medical School

&gt; working off and on.) Also Paola Iten -  She can be reached in the

I received word this morning that both the Aristide Foundation for Democracy and the Medical University at Tabarre survived the earthquake. They are receiving refugees and injured people -- 10,000 people are there right now.  There are 53 doctors on site now, no medical supplies left. They are literally five minutes from the airport -- over a road that is passable (Blvd 15 Octobre) in Tabarre.   There is also ample room to store supplies, and a disciplined staff to manage them.  Both sites have generators, but are running low on gas.  And are running out of water and food. Toussaint Hilaire - local phone 491-4465

The route from SD to PAP (305) is open but congested.
Trouin (coordinates of Catholic church, which had hardly any damage, are 18Â°21.962â€™ -72Â°39.283â€™), there was another space where people are camping out like a refugee camp (we saw probably 60-70 people there this am, probably many more sleep there at night).  Five people died when the Episcopal church collapsed there, and many houses are down.  They said they are just about out of drinking water at the camp and will probably be going to the river to get their water but donâ€™t have anything to treat it.  They said there is a safe source over a mountain but havenâ€™t been able to get there yet and may not be able to do so.  Pere Frito, the Episcopal priest in Trouin, was in PAP during the quake.  I got his #s from another guy â€“ they are 3633-2787 (Digicel) and 3405-1700 (Voila), in case that helps anyone if we end up being able to do anything to get them chlorine.

UND/CDC place in Leogane (coordinates above), there is a large yard that is being used like a refugee camp for hundreds of people â€“ lots of tarps held up by wooden posts and a few tents.  They just got a drum of gas and are using it sparingly â€“ apparently theyâ€™ve been running the generator for about an hour a couple times each day.  Theyâ€™re not aware of any other place to get internet in Leogane.
This densely populated area is said to be a &quot;broken mess&quot;. Entire blocks have been destroyed and survivors have lined up on the streets with belongings salvaged from piles of rubble. The area has the highest jobless rate in the metropolitan area, with about two-thirds of adults unemployed.
The road from Leogane to Jacmel blocked with landslides at 18Â°23.938â€™ -72Â°38.277â€™ (just north of the turn off to Trouin and Baudin) and is passable only on foot or moto.  Transporting gas beyond that point will become very difficult until this is resolved.

&gt; Continue straight and down a steep hill that had one bridge completed and another under construction spanning a deep ravine.  Continue 
straight to the second street.  There is a tree on an island in the middle of the road.  Shortly afterward the road splits.  Take the 
right fork, which curves very sharply to the right and up a steep hill.  The house is the property around which the road curves.  Its gate is the first one on the right.

Bresma has 3 buildings in PaP : it appears Bresma I is okay (and those are the ones for which we had coordinates), and the children from Bresma II have been transferred there. Bresma II is listed as being a &quot;little damaged&quot;. Bresma III also has damaged buildings, and children have been transferred to the guest house.

is George Sada. He is registered with the US embassy. He lives at #8 Rue
Merisier Prolonge in Musseau. He in near Delmas 48 and Delmas 60. He can be
reached by Rue Merisier or Impasse Roussan Prolonge.



I spoke with him on Weds morning at 3:30 and he seemed disoriented and could
not tell us if he had enough food and water for a couple of days. We can no
longer reach him and are very worried. He is 71 years old and a  cardiac
patient. He has medicine but we can't be sure he is taking it. He was afraid
to go back into the house and we don't know if it is still structurally
sound. He is alone and we can't reach anyone around him to go and check on
him.

My mother used to work for the US embassy and we always keep in touch just
in case something happens.
Can you find out any information regarding my father? Maybe if there is a
rescue team in the area someone can check on him.  He told me that there was
a hotel up the street from him that collapsed but that his immediate
neighbors are ok.



Thank you for any information you can gather.

"Location: 18.451Â°N, 72.445Â°W
Depth: 10 km (6.2 miles) set by location program

The January 12, 2010, Haiti earthquake occurred in the boundary region separating the Caribbean plate and the North America plate. This plate boundary is dominated by left-lateral strike slip motion and compression, and accommodates about 20 mm/y slip, with the Caribbean plate moving eastward with respect to the North America plate.

Haiti occupies the western part of the island of Hispaniola, one of the Greater Antilles islands, situated between Puerto Rico and Cuba. At the longitude of the January 12 earthquake, motion between the Caribbean and North American plates is partitioned between two major east-west trending, strike-slip fault systems -- the Septentrional fault system in northern Haiti and the Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault system in southern Haiti.

The location and focal mechanism of the earthquake are consistent with the event having occurred as left-lateral strike slip faulting on the Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault system. This fault system accommodates about 7 mm/y, nearly half the overall motion between the Caribbean plate and North America plate.

The Enriquillo-Plaintain Garden fault system has not produced a major earthquake in recent decades. The EPGFZ is the likely source of historical large earthquakes in 1860, 1770, 1761, 1751, 1684, 1673, and 1618, though none of these has been confirmed in the field as associated with this fault."
The Karibe Hotel and ajoining apartments have collapsed.  My brother and his three daughters - aged 2 to 6 are trapped inside one of the apartments in the Karibe compound.  His wife, Emily Sanson-Rejouis can hear the baby cry.  She urgently needs help.  She has been waiting for help for the last 12 hours.  The baby is crying.
The Martissant health center in a poor area of Port-au-Prince had to be evacuated after the earthquake because it was damaged and unstable. The patients are now in tents in the grounds and the medical staff have been dealing with a flow of casualties from the town. They have already treated between 300 and 350 people, mainly for trauma injuries and fractures. Among them are 50 people suffering from burnsâ€”some of them severeâ€”many of them caused by domestic gas containers exploding in collapsing buidings.

"This report was issued by the Office of the Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs in New York. The next report will be issued on or around 13 January 2010.

A powerful earthquake of 7.0 magnitude (USGS) on the Richter Scale affected Haiti on 12 January, at 16.53hrs local time (GMT 21.53hrs). The earthquake happened 17km south-west of Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti (18.45N, 72.45W). Initial reports suggest a high number of casualties and widespread damage, with an urgent need for Search and Rescue.
A United Nations Disaster and Assessment coordination Team (UNDAC) is being mobilized.                               II. Situation Overview
On Tuesday 12 January, at approximately 16.53hrs local time, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake on the Richter
Scale, and less than 10 km deep, was recorded off the coast of Haiti, and only 17 km from the capital, Port-
au-Prince. Aftershocks have been felt measuring 5.9 and 5.5 respectively. More aftershocks are expected in
the coming hours.
The mission of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) is to mobilize and coordinate effective and
principled humanitarian action in partnership with national and international actors.
The capital of Haiti, Port-au-Prince, has been severely affected including critical city infrastructure
components such as, electricity, water and phone services. Electricity is not available and communications
are difficult. Initial reports indicate a large number of casualties and widespread damage.
At this stage there is very limited access because of debris and other obstacles on the roads. The airport of
Port-au-Prince is reported to be closed. The Presidential Palace and Government buildings are reported to
have been seriously damaged. According to preliminary reports, several UN and well as other national
buildings have collapsed or have been damaged. Populations may also be affected in Carrefour and Jacmel. 
United Nations agencies, as well as the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Society
are preparing the deployment of teams and humanitarian assistance, notably from their regional hub in
Panama. USAID/OFDA is sending a response team in addition to 2 USAR (Urban Search and Rescue) heavy
teams.
OCHA is mobilizing a United Nations Disaster and Assessment Coordination Team (UNDAC) and is
deploying staff from its Regional Office in Panama.
There has been no immediate report of damage in Cuba and the Dominican Republic. Tsunami alerts were
lifted, including for Haiti.
III. Humanitarian Needs and Response
Evacuation of injured, medical supplies and expertise are needed. Also clean water may be urgently needed
very soon.
IV. Funding
All humanitarian partners including donors and recipient agencies are encouraged to inform FTS of cash and
in-kind contributions by sending an email to: fts@reliefweb.int.

Canape Vert, one of the main roads that leads from the downtown area of Port-au-Prince to Petion-ville has collapsed near the area of Delmas 60. Sections of the road slid down the mountain onto homes which where built into the mountainside.
"My mother is part of a medical team that had just arrived in Port-au-Prince. We received a text that she and two others are trapped beneath the rubble of their guesthouse:

Wallâ€™s International Guest House
Delmas 19, Rue Mackendal #8"
"Tequila Minsky, a New York-based photographer who is staying at the Hotel Oloffson in Port-au-Prince â€” which was the model for the Haitian hotel in Graham Greeneâ€™s novel â€œThe Comediansâ€ â€” told my colleague Patrick Witty, a photo editor on the New York Times foreign desk, what she saw immediately after the earthquake. She had arrived at the hotel just two hours before the quake struck, shaking the walls of her room shook and knocking things off it.

She immediately went out and started taking pictures on the surrounding streets. The wall at the front of the hotel had fallen down and killed someone. A number of nearby buildings had collapsed, trapping people. A woman was crying and saying, â€œMy uncle, my uncle.â€ A bank building was very badly damaged in the Rue Capois which runs along the side of the hotel. People were screaming. â€œIt was general mayhem,â€ she said.

By 6:30, she said, it was dark and fires were burning downtown, near the shoreline."
NBC reports Port-au-Prince air traffic control tower has been severely damaged, resulting in re-routing of flights by other Haitian air traffic facilities. May contextualize conflicting reports of 1) airport closure and 2) incidence of aircraft take-off.
National Palace has extensive damage. President and First Lady are safe.
