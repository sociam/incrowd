# incrowd
Prototype of the INCROWD observatory dashboard for near real-time monitoring of crowdsourced disaster response data


Repo has a .gitIgnore file, users will need to add manualy:

Add a new file to the private folder:
/private/apiCredentials.js

Add this code to the apiCredentials.json file:

```
{
  "key": "YOUR_CRISIS_NET_KEY_HERE"
}

NOTE: Make sure the file is a .json and not .js :P
